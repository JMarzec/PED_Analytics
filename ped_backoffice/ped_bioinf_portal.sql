Although gene expression profiling by DNA microarray analysis is a promising tool for the development of such detection systems, a simple comparison of pancreatic tissues may yield misleading data that reflect only differences in cellular composition. To directly compare PDC cells with normal pancreatic ductal cells, we purified MUC1-positive epithelial cells from the pancreatic juices of 25 individuals with a normal pancreas and 24 patients with PDC. The gene expression profiles of these 49 specimens were determined with DNA microarrays containing >44 000 probe sets. Application of both Welch&apo;s analysis of variance and effect size-based selection to the expression data resulted in the identification of 21 probe sets corresponding to 20 genes whose expression was highly associated with clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, correspondence analysis and 3-D projection with these probe sets resulted in separation of the transcriptomes of pancreatic ductal cells into distinct but overlapping spaces corresponding to the two clinical classes. To establish an accurate transcriptome-based diagnosis system for PDC, we applied supervised class prediction algorithms to our large data set. With the expression profiles of only five predictor genes, the weighted vote method diagnosed the class of samples with an accuracy of 81.6%. Microarray analysis with purified pancreatic ductal cells has thus provided a basis for the development of a sensitive method for the detection of PDC.\n','2005-08-01',0,'PCA,Tumour purity,Gene expression,Correlations'),(337152,'17699763','Zonal heterogeneity for gene expression in human pancreatic carcinoma.','Nakamura T,Kuwai T,Kitadai Y,Sasaki T,Fan D,Coombes KR,Kim SJ,Fidler IJ','Cancer research','Using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 array and laser capture microdissection techniques, we determined whether different zones of the same pancreatic tumor exhibited differential expression of genes.

Bioinformatic functional analysis revealed that 346 up-regulated genes in the peripheral zone were related to cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis, cell cycle, cell adhesion, cell motility, DNA replication, localization, integrin-mediated signaling pathway, development, morphogenesis, and IkappaB kinase/nuclear factor-kappaB cascade; 876 up-regulated genes in the central zone were related to regulation of cell proliferation, regulation of transcription, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, response to stress, small GTPase-mediated signal transduction, hexose metabolism, cell death, response to external stimulus, carbohydrate metabolism, and response to wounding. The reliability of the microarray results were confirmed by in situ hybridization analysis of the expression of two genes.

Two of 10 tumors were sensitive, and by global gene expression profiling with gene set enrichment analysis, the EGFR pathway was highly expressed in sensitive compared with resistant tumors.

Identifying combinations of targets that concurrently express in tumor cells but not in normal cells is a challenging task. Here, we describe a novel approach for identifying such combinations using genome-wide gene expression profiling followed by immunohistochemistry. We first generated a database of mRNA gene expression profiles for 28 pancreatic cancer specimens and 103 normal tissue samples representing 28 unique tissue/cell types using DNA microarrays. The expression data for genes that encode proteins with cell-surface epitopes were then extracted from the database and analyzed using a novel multivariate rule-based computational approach to identify gene combinations that are expressed at an efficient binding level in tumors but not in normal tissues. These combinations were further ranked according to the proportion of tumor samples that expressed the sets at efficient levels. Protein expression of the genes contained in the top ranked combinations was confirmed using immunohistochemistry on a pancreatic tumor tissue and normal tissue microarrays. Coexpression of targets was further validated by their combined expression in pancreatic cancer cell lines using immunocytochemistry.

In vitro, we show that pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp90 by IPI-504 exerts antiproliferative effects in a panel of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In pancreatic cancer xenografts obtained directly from patients with pancreas cancer, the agent resulted in a marked suppression of tumor growth. Although known Hsp90 client proteins were significantly modulated in IPI-504-treated cell line, no consistent alteration of these proteins was observed in vivo other than induction of Hsp70 expression in the treated xenografted tumors.

The majority of these proteins belong to the functional class of intracellular signal transduction, immune response, cell growth and maintenance, transport, and metabolism.

Thus it is not clear which of the genes that have been found differentially expressed between normal and whole tumor tissues are due to the tumor epithelia and which simply reflect the differences in cellular composition. To address this problem, laser microdissection studies have been performed, but these have to deal with much smaller tissue sample quantities and therefore have significantly higher experimental noise.\nIn this paper we combine our own large sample whole-tissue study with a previously published smaller sample microdissection study by GrÃ¼tzmann et al. to identify the genes that are specifically overexpressed in PDAC tumor epithelia.\nThe overlap of this list of genes with other microarray studies of pancreatic cancer as well as with the published literature is impressive. Moreover, we find a number of genes whose over-expression appears to be inversely correlated with patient survival: keratin 7, laminin gamma 2, stratifin, platelet phosphofructokinase, annexin A2, MAP4K4 and OACT2 (MBOAT2), which are all specifically upregulated in the neoplastic epithelia, rather than the tumor stroma.\nWe improve on other microarray studies of PDAC by putting together the higher statistical power due to a larger number of samples with information about cell-type specific expression and patient survival.\n','2009-03-05',0,'PCA,Tumour purity,Gene expression,Correlations'),(337158,'19732725','FKBP51 affects cancer cell response to chemotherapy by negatively regulating Akt.','Pei H,Li L,Fridley BL,Jenkins GD,Kalari KR,Lingle W,Petersen G,Lou Z,Wang L','Cancer cell','Akt is a central regulator of cell growth.

Furthermore, FKBP51 is downregulated in pancreatic cancer tissue samples and several cancer cell lines. Decreased FKBP51 expression in cancer cells results in hyperphosphorylation of Akt and decreased cell death following genotoxic stress.

Molecular mechanisms were investigated via gene expression profiling. Masitinib as a single agent had no significant antiproliferative activity while the masitinib/gemcitabine combination showed synergy in vitro on proliferation of gemcitabine-refractory cell lines Mia Paca2 and Panc1, and to a lesser extent in vivo on Mia Paca2 cell tumour growth. Specifically, masitinib at 10 microM strongly sensitised Mia Paca2 cells to gemcitabine (>400-fold reduction in IC(50)); and moderately sensitised Panc1 cells (10-fold reduction). Transcriptional analysis identified the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway as down-regulated in the cell lines resensitised by the masitinib/gemcitabine combination.\nThese data establish proof-of-concept that masitinib can sensitise gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic cancer cell lines and warrant further in vivo investigation.

These models included: 1) TGFÎ²-induced EMT, which provided a look at the active transition between states; 2) a panel of 22 pancreatic cancer cell lines, which represented terminal differentiation states of either epithelial-like or mesenchymal-like; and 3) actively-migrating and stationary cells, which provided a look at the mechanism of migration. We analyzed expression data from a list of 587 genes involved in glycosylation (biosynthesis, sugar transport, glycan-binding, etc.) or EMT. Glycogenes were altered at a higher prevalence than all other genes in the first two models (p<0.05 and <0.005, respectively) but not in the migration model.

Therefore, we provide evidence that DPEP1 plays a role in pancreatic cancer aggressiveness and predicts outcome in patients with resected PDAC.

Expression of WNT2 in pancreatic cancer cells suppresses anoikis, enhances anchorage-independent sphere formation, and increases metastatic propensity in vivo. This effect is correlated with fibronectin upregulation and suppressed by inhibition of MAP3K7 (also known as TAK1) kinase. In humans, formation of non-adherent tumour spheres by pancreatic cancer cells is associated with upregulation of multiple WNT genes, and pancreatic CTCs revealed enrichment for WNT signalling in 5 out of 11 cases.

An enriched set of 33 genes differentially expressed in common between primary PDAC and liver metastases, when compared to normal tissues, was obtained through global gene expression profiling. This metastasis-associated gene set comprises transcripts from both cancer (S100P, S100A6, AGR2, etc.) and adjacent stroma (collagens type I, III, and V, etc.), thus reinforcing the concept of a continuous crosstalk between the two compartments in both primary tumours and their metastases. The expression of S100P, SFN, VCAN and collagens was further validated in additional primary PDACs and matched liver metastatic lesions, while the functional significance of one of the most highly expressed genes, S100P, was studied in more detail. We show that this protein increases the transendothelial migration of PDAC cancer cells in vitro, which was also confirmed in vivo experiments using a zebrafish embryo model.

Thus, the material was procured before pancreatic cancer has developed, rather than from PanINs in a tissue field that already contains cancer. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling using such unique specimens was performed. Bulk frozen sections displaying the most extensive but not microdissected PanIN-2/3 lesions were used in order to obtain the holistic view of both the precursor lesions and their microenvironment.

This was particularly pronounced in the stromal and immune responses.\nOur comprehensive analysis of precursor lesions without the invasive component provides the definitive molecular proof that PanIN lesions beget cancer from a molecular standpoint. We demonstrate the need for accumulation of transcriptomic changes during the progression of PanIN to PDAC, both in the epithelium and in the surrounding stroma.

The GNAS mutation is not observed in conventional ductal adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. To determine the functional significance of the GNAS mutation in pancreatic ductal lineage cells, we examined in vitro phenotypes of cells of pancreatic ductal lineage, HPDE, PK-8, PCI-35, and MIA PaCa-2, with exogenous expression of either wild-type or mutated (R201H) GNAS. We found that exogenous GNAS upregulated intracellular cyclic adenine monophosphate (cAMP), particularly in mutated GNAS transfectants, and upregulated expression of MUC2 and MUC5AC in HPDE and PK-8 cells. By contrast, exogenous GNAS inhibited expression of mucin genes in PCI-35 and MIA PaCa-2 cells, despite upregulation of cAMP. We examined global gene expression profiles of some of the cells transfected with exogenous mutated GNAS (PK-8, PCI-35, and MIA PaCa-2), and found that PK-8 cells exhibited drastic alterations of the gene expression profile, which contrasted with modest alterations in PCI-35 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. To identify a cause of these different effects of exogenous mutated GNAS on phenotypes of the cells, we examined effects of interactions of the signaling pathways of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) on expression of mucin genes. The MAPK and PI3K pathways significantly influenced the expression of mucin genes. Exogenous GNAS did not promote cell growth but suppressed it in some of the cells. In conclusion, mutated GNAS found in IPMNs may extensively alter gene expression profiles, including expression of mucin genes, through the interaction with MAPK and PI3K pathways in pancreatic ductal cells; these changes may determine the characteristic phenotype of IPMN.

The results obtained in the PDAC system were further compared with public available microarray data from 42 PDX models, 108 primary tumors and 32 cell lines from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We developed a robust analysis protocol to explore the gene expression space. In addition, we completed the analysis with a functional characterization of PDX models, including if changes were caused by murine environment or by serial passing.\nOur results showed that PDX models derived from PDAC, or HCC, were clearly different to the cell lines derived from the same cancer tissues. Indeed, PDAC- and HCC-derived cell lines are indistinguishable from each other based on their gene expression profiles. In contrast, the transcriptomes of PDAC and HCC PDX models can be separated into two different groups that share some partial similarity with their corresponding original primary tumors. Our results point to the lack of human stromal involvement in PDXs as a major factor contributing to their differences from the original primary tumors. The main functional differences between pancreatic PDX models and human PDAC are the lower expression of genes involved in pathways related to extracellular matrix and hemostasis and the up- regulation of cell cycle genes. Importantly, most of these differences are detected in the first passages after the tumor engraftment.\nOur results suggest that PDX models of PDAC and HCC retain, to some extent, a gene expression memory of the original primary tumors, while this pattern is not detected in conventional cancer cell lines. Expression changes in PDXs are mainly related to pathways reflecting the lack of human infiltrating cells and the adaptation to a new environment. We also provide evidence of the stability of gene expression patterns over subsequent passages, indicating early phases of the adaptation process.\n','2014-08-12',0,'PCA,Tumour purity,Gene expression,Correlations'),(337173,'25242334','Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies extracellular matrix gene expression by pancreatic circulating tumor cells.','Ting DT,Wittner BS,Ligorio M,Vincent Jordan N,Shah AM,Miyamoto DT,Aceto N,Bersani F,Brannigan BW,Xega K,Ciciliano JC,Zhu H,MacKenzie OC,Trautwein J,Arora KS,Shahid M,Ellis HL,Qu N,Bardeesy N,Rivera MN,Deshpande V,Ferrone CR,Kapur R,Ramaswamy S,Shioda T,Toner M,Maheswaran S,Haber DA','Cell reports','Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are shed from primary tumors into the bloodstream, mediating the hematogenous spread of cancer to distant organs.

SOX9 expression was manipulated in human cell lines and mouse models developing PDAC.\nWe found genetic aberrations in the SOX9 gene in about 15% of patient tumours. Most PDAC samples strongly express SOX9 protein, and SOX9 levels are higher in classical PDAC. This tumour subtype is associated with better patient outcome, and cell lines of this subtype respond to therapy targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERBB1) signalling, a pathway essential for pancreatic tumourigenesis. In human PDAC, high expression of SOX9 correlates with expression of genes belonging to the ERBB pathway. In particular, ERBB2 expression in PDAC cell lines is stimulated by SOX9. Inactivating Sox9 expression in mice confirmed its role in PDAC initiation; it demonstrated that Sox9 stimulates expression of several members of the ERBB pathway and is required for ERBB signalling activity.\nBy integrating data from patient samples and mouse models, we found that SOX9 regulates the ERBB pathway throughout pancreatic tumourigenesis.

The prognosis depends on the histological subtype, as well as on the anatomical site of origin, the former being the more important. The molecular basis for these differences in prognosis is poorly understood. Whole-genome analyses were used to investigate the association between molecular tumor profiles, pathogenesis and prognosis. A total of 85 periampullary adenocarcinomas were characterized by mRNA and miRNA expressions profiling. Molecular profiles of the tumors from the different anatomical sites of origin as well as of the different histological subtypes were compared. Differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs between the two histopathological subtypes were linked to specific molecular pathways. Six miRNA families were downregulated and four were upregulated in the pancreatobiliary type as compared to the intestinal type (P < 0.05). miRNAs and mRNAs associated with improved overall and recurrence free survival for the two histopathological subtypes were identified.

The mechanistic studies suggest that the endothelial cells act through the secretion of EGFL7. Consistently, endothelial overexpression of EGFL7 in vivo using a transgenic mouse model resulted in an increase of PP proliferation rate and a decrease of differentiation toward endocrine cells.

Here we show that autophagy induction in PDA occurs as part of a broader transcriptional program that coordinates activation of lysosome biogenesis and function, and nutrient scavenging, mediated by the MiT/TFE family of transcription factors. In human PDA cells, the MiT/TFE proteins--MITF, TFE3 and TFEB--are decoupled from regulatory mechanisms that control their cytoplasmic retention. Increased nuclear import in turn drives the expression of a coherent network of genes that induce high levels of lysosomal catabolic function essential for PDA growth. Unbiased global metabolite profiling reveals that MiT/TFE-dependent autophagy-lysosome activation is specifically required to maintain intracellular amino acid pools.

A new category of drugs, called epigenetic inhibitors, are being developed that hold high promise for inhibition of the WNT pathway. The canonical WNT signaling pathway initiates when WNT ligands bind to receptors, causing the nuclear localization of the co-activator Î²-catenin (CTNNB1), which leads to an association of Î²-catenin with a member of the TCF transcription factor family at regulatory regions of WNT-responsive genes. The TCF/Î²-catenin complex then recruits CBP (CREBBP) or p300 (EP300), leading to histone acetylation and gene activation. A current model in the field is that CBP-driven expression of WNT target genes supports proliferation whereas p300-driven expression of WNT target genes supports differentiation. The small molecule inhibitor ICG-001 binds to CBP, but not to p300, and competitively inhibits the interaction of CBP with Î²-catenin. Upon treatment of cancer cells, this should reduce expression of CBP-regulated transcription, leading to reduced tumorigenicity and enhanced differentiation.\nWe have compared the genome-wide effects on the transcriptome after treatment with ICG-001 (the specific CBP inhibitor) versus C646, a compound that competes with acetyl-coA for the Lys-coA binding pocket of both CBP and p300. We found that both drugs cause large-scale changes in the transcriptome of HCT116 colon cancer cells and PANC1 pancreatic cancer cells and reverse some tumor-specific changes in gene expression. Interestingly, although the epigenetic inhibitors affect cell cycle pathways in both the colon and pancreatic cancer cell lines, the WNT signaling pathway was affected only in the colon cancer cells. Notably, WNT target genes were similarly downregulated after treatment of HCT116 with C646 as with ICG-001.\nOur results suggest that treatment with a general HAT inhibitor causes similar effects on the transcriptome as does treatment with a CBP-specific inhibitor and that epigenetic inhibition affects the WNT pathway in HCT116 cells and the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in PANC1 cells.\n','2015-07-20',0,''),(337181,'26343385','Virtual microdissection identifies distinct tumor- and stroma-specific subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.','Moffitt RA,Marayati R,Flate EL,Volmar KE,Loeza SG,Hoadley KA,Rashid NU,Williams LA,Eaton SC,Chung AH,Smyla JK,Anderson JM,Kim HJ,Bentrem DJ,Talamonti MS,Iacobuzio-Donahue CA,Hollingsworth MA,Yeh JJ','Nature genetics','Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a lethal disease with a 5-year survival rate of 4%.

The genomic alterations that commonly occur in pancreatic cancer include activation of KRAS2 and inactivation of p53 and SMAD4 (refs 2-4). So far, however, it has been challenging to target these pathways therapeutically; thus the search for other key mediators of pancreatic cancer growth remains an important endeavour. Here we show that the stem cell determinant Musashi (Msi) is a critical element of pancreatic cancer progression both in genetic models and in patient-derived xenografts. Specifically, we developed Msi reporter mice that allowed image-based tracking of stem cell signals within cancers, revealing that Msi expression rises as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia progresses to adenocarcinoma, and that Msi-expressing cells are key drivers of pancreatic cancer: they preferentially harbour the capacity to propagate adenocarcinoma, are enriched in circulating tumour cells, and are markedly drug resistant. This population could be effectively targeted by deletion of either Msi1 or Msi2, which led to a striking defect in the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to adenocarcinoma and an improvement in overall survival. Msi inhibition also blocked the growth of primary patient-derived tumours, suggesting that this signal is required for human disease. To define the translational potential of this work we developed antisense oligonucleotides against Msi; these showed reliable tumour penetration, uptake and target inhibition, and effectively blocked pancreatic cancer growth. Collectively, these studies highlight Msi reporters as a unique tool to identify therapy resistance, and define Msi signalling as a central regulator of pancreatic cancer.\n','2016-06-16',0,''),(337184,'27282075','RNA sequencing of pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors yields novel expression patterns associated with long-term survival and reveals a role for ANGPTL4.','Kirby MK,Ramaker RC,Gertz J,Davis NS,Johnston BE,Oliver PG,Sexton KC,Greeno EW,Christein JD,Heslin MJ,Posey JA,Grizzle WE,Vickers SM,Buchsbaum DJ,Cooper SJ,Myers RM','Molecular oncology','Pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients have low survival rates due to late-stage diagnosis and high rates of cancer recurrence even after surgical resection. It is important to understand the molecular characteristics associated with survival differences in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors that may inform patient care.\nRNA sequencing was performed for 51 patient tumor tissues extracted from patients undergoing surgical resection, and expression was associated with overall survival time from diagnosis. Our analysis uncovered 323 transcripts whose expression correlates with survival time in our pancreatic patient cohort. This genomic signature was validated in an independent RNA-seq dataset of 68 additional patients from the International Cancer Genome Consortium. We demonstrate that this transcriptional profile is largely independent of markers of cellular division and present a 19-transcript predictive model built from a subset of the 323 transcripts that can distinguish patients with differing survival times across both the training and validation patient cohorts. We present evidence that a subset of the survival-associated transcripts is associated with resistance to gemcitabine treatment inÂ vitro, and reveal that reduced expression of one of the survival-associated transcripts, Angiopoietin-like 4, impairs growth of a gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line.\nGene expression patterns in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors can distinguish patients with differing survival outcomes after undergoing surgical resection, and the survival difference could be associated with the intrinsic gemcitabine sensitivity of primary patient tumors. Thus, these transcriptional differences may impact patient care by distinguishing patients who would benefit from a non-gemcitabine based therapy.\nCopyright Â© 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Knowing the identity of the stem cell is crucial to understanding tissue homeostasis and its aberrations upon disease. Here we present a computational method for the derivation of a lineage tree from single-cell transcriptome data. By exploiting the tree topology and the transcriptome composition, we establish StemID, an algorithm for identifying stem cells among all detectable cell types within a population. We demonstrate that StemID recovers two known adult stem cell populations, Lgr5+ cells in the small intestine and hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. We apply StemID to predict candidate multipotent cell populations in the human pancreas, a tissue with largely uncharacterized turnover dynamics. We hope that StemID will accelerate the search for novel stem cells by providing concrete markers for biological follow-up and validation.\nCopyright Â© 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we use exome sequencing ofÂ patient tumors and find multiple conserved genetic alterations. However, the majority of tumors exhibit no clearly defined therapeutic target. High-throughput drug screens using patient-derived cell lines found rare examples of sensitivity to monotherapy, with most models requiring combination therapy. Using PDX models, we confirmed the effectiveness and selectivity of the identified treatment responses. Out of more than 500 single and combination drug regimens tested, no single treatment was effective for the majority of PDAC tumors, and each case had unique sensitivity profiles that could not be predicted using genetic analyses. These data indicate a shortcoming of reliance on genetic analysis to predict efficacy of currently available agents against PDAC and suggest that sensitivity profiling of patient-derived models could inform personalized therapy design for PDAC.\nCopyright Â© 2016 The Author(s).

However, the genetics of metastases largely reflects that of the primary tumor in untreated patients, and PDAC driver mutations are shared by all subclones. This raises the possibility that an epigenetic process might operate during metastasis. Here we report large-scale reprogramming of chromatin modifications during the natural evolution of distant metastasis. Changes were targeted to thousands of large chromatin domains across the genome that collectively specified malignant traits, including euchromatin and large organized chromatin histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-modified (LOCK) heterochromatin. Remarkably, distant metastases co-evolved a dependence on the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP), and oxPPP inhibition selectively reversed reprogrammed chromatin, malignant gene expression programs, and tumorigenesis. These findings suggest a model whereby linked metabolic-epigenetic programs are selected for enhanced tumorigenic fitness during the evolution of distant metastasis.\n','2017-01-16',0,''),(337188,'11742071','Multiclass cancer diagnosis using tumor gene expression signatures.','Ramaswamy S,Tamayo P,Rifkin R,Mukherjee S,Yeang CH,Angelo M,Ladd C,Reich M,Latulippe E,Mesirov JP,Poggio T,Gerald W,Loda M,Lander ES,Golub TR','Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America','The optimal treatment of patients with cancer depends on establishing accurate diagnoses by using a complex combination of clinical and histopathological data. In some instances, this task is difficult or impossible because of atypical clinical presentation or histopathology. To determine whether the diagnosis of multiple common adult malignancies could be achieved purely by molecular classification, we subjected 218 tumor samples, spanning 14 common tumor types, and 90 normal tissue samples to oligonucleotide microarray gene expression analysis. The expression levels of 16,063 genes and expressed sequence tags were used to evaluate the accuracy of a multiclass classifier based on a support vector machine algorithm. Overall classification accuracy was 78%, far exceeding the accuracy of random classification (9%). Poorly differentiated cancers resulted in low-confidence predictions and could not be accurately classified according to their tissue of origin, indicating that they are molecularly distinct entities with dramatically different gene expression patterns compared with their well differentiated counterparts. Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of accurate, multiclass molecular cancer classification and suggest a strategy for future clinical implementation of molecular cancer diagnostics.\n','2001-12-25',0,''),(337189,'17767167','Death-receptor O-glycosylation controls tumor-cell sensitivity to the proapoptotic ligand Apo2L/TRAIL.','Wagner KW,Punnoose EA,Januario T,Lawrence DA,Pitti RM,Lancaster K,Lee D,von Goetz M,Yee SF,Totpal K,Huw L,Katta V,Cavet G,Hymowitz SG,Amler L,Ashkenazi A','Nature medicine','Apo2L/TRAIL stimulates cancer cell death through the proapoptotic receptors DR4 and DR5, but the determinants of tumor susceptibility to this ligand are not fully defined. mRNA expression of the peptidyl O-glycosyltransferase GALNT14 correlated with Apo2L/TRAIL sensitivity in pancreatic carcinoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma and melanoma cell lines, and up to 30% of samples from various human malignancies showed GALNT14 overexpression. RNA interference of GALNT14 reduced cellular Apo2L/TRAIL sensitivity, whereas overexpression increased responsiveness. Biochemical analysis of DR5 identified several ectodomain O-(N-acetyl galactosamine-galactose-sialic acid) structures. Sequence comparison predicted conserved extracellular DR4 and DR5 O-glycosylation sites; progressive mutation of the DR5 sites attenuated apoptotic signaling. O-glycosylation promoted ligand-stimulated clustering of DR4 and DR5, which mediated recruitment and activation of the apoptosis-initiating protease caspase-8.

However, the extent of natural antisense transcripts&apo; (NATs) expression, their regulation of cognate sense genes, and the role of NATs in cancer remain poorly understood. Here, we use strand-specific paired-end RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq) data from 376 cancer samples covering nine tissue types to comprehensively characterize the landscape of antisense expression. We found consistent antisense expression in at least 38% of annotated transcripts, which in general is positively correlated with sense gene expression. Investigation of sense/antisense pair expressions across tissue types revealed lineage-specific, ubiquitous and cancer-specific antisense loci transcription. Comparisons between tumor and normal samples identified both concordant (same direction) and discordant (opposite direction) sense/antisense expression patterns. Finally, we provide OncoNAT, a catalog of cancer-related genes with significant antisense transcription, which will enable future investigations of sense/antisense regulation in cancer.
